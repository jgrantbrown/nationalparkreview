NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on.

Twenty-mile Park Loop Road is the best way to take it all in, teetering high above the sea with spacious coastal views before careening inland through mountainous forest and meadow-carpeted valleys.\nBe sure to hike or bike along the park’s 57 miles of serene carriage roads — built by John D.

Just as amazing is the life in the surrounding waters: more than 30 species of sea animals – sea lions, elephant seals, whales – cavort about.\n\nOf special note: The largest aggregation of blue whales in the world convenes here every summer.

Twenty-mile Park Loop Road is the best way to take it all in, teetering high above the sea with spacious coastal views before careening inland through mountainous forest and meadow-carpeted valleys.\nBe sure to hike or bike along the park’s 57 miles of serene carriage roads — built by John D.

Just as amazing is the life in the surrounding waters: more than 30 species of sea animals – sea lions, elephant seals, whales – cavort about.\n\nOf special note: The largest aggregation of blue whales in the world convenes here every summer.

With reason. Some may reach over 50 feet tall and last up to 200 years – the biggest may have 40 twisting arms. Beloved symbol of the Old West, this prickly giant is the linchpin of Saguaro National Park, which comprises two units straddling Tucson, Arizona. You’ll find the largest concentration in the park’s hotter, drier Tucson Mountain District unit, to the west of Tucson.\n\nIn the Rincon Mountain District, 30 miles east, the higher, slightly wetter “high desert” environment, you may also spot white-tailed deer, javelinas, Mexican spotted owl, black bears, and, if you’re lucky, the elusive kudamundi. While the saguaro get most of the limelight, you’ll see plenty of other cactus too, including staghorn, barrel, fishhook, prickly pear and teddy bear.\n\nIf you can, visit during the summer wildflower display – Mexican gold poppies kick off the show, followed by penstemons, lupines, desert marigolds and brittlebushes. The saguaros bloom late May through to June — beautiful white flowers that open at night and last for merely 24 hours.

The pièce de résistance, proudly displayed on Utah license plates, is Delicate Arch — with iconic redrock that’s at its most sublime at sunset.\n\nAll that said, there are more than arches here: thin fins, towers, bridges, balanced rocks, and spindly needles add to the otherworldly, high-desert sculpture garden, all with whimsical names that somehow perfectly describe them: Courthouse Towers, Parade of Elephants, and Balanced Rock are some of the favorites. Hikers wander around this stone fantasyland on short and long trails, while rock climbers rejoice in the surrounds.

Just as amazing is the life in the surrounding waters: more than 30 species of sea animals – sea lions, elephant seals, whales – cavort about.\n\nOf special note: The largest aggregation of blue whales in the world convenes here every summer.

Twenty-mile Park Loop Road is the best way to take it all in, teetering high above the sea with spacious coastal views before careening inland through mountainous forest and meadow-carpeted valleys.\nBe sure to hike or bike along the park’s 57 miles of serene carriage roads — built by John D.

Just as amazing is the life in the surrounding waters: more than 30 species of sea animals – sea lions, elephant seals, whales – cavort about.\n\nOf special note: The largest aggregation of blue whales in the world convenes here every summer.

Just as amazing is the life in the surrounding waters: more than 30 species of sea animals – sea lions, elephant seals, whales – cavort about.\n\nOf special note: The largest aggregation of blue whales in the world convenes here every summer.

With reason. Some may reach over 50 feet tall and last up to 200 years – the biggest may have 40 twisting arms. Beloved symbol of the Old West, this prickly giant is the linchpin of Saguaro National Park, which comprises two units straddling Tucson, Arizona. You’ll find the largest concentration in the park’s hotter, drier Tucson Mountain District unit, to the west of Tucson.\n\nIn the Rincon Mountain District, 30 miles east, the higher, slightly wetter “high desert” environment, you may also spot white-tailed deer, javelinas, Mexican spotted owl, black bears, and, if you’re lucky, the elusive kudamundi. While the saguaro get most of the limelight, you’ll see plenty of other cactus too, including staghorn, barrel, fishhook, prickly pear and teddy bear.\n\nIf you can, visit during the summer wildflower display – Mexican gold poppies kick off the show, followed by penstemons, lupines, desert marigolds and brittlebushes. The saguaros bloom late May through to June — beautiful white flowers that open at night and last for merely 24 hours.

This is a good thing, given the road’s precipitous, winding nature (and the temptation to keep peering at the ever-more-dramatic landscape).\n\nA constant companion on the southern horizon are the massive, snowcapped peaks of the Alaska Range, topped by the surreal, 20,320-ft Denali (aka Mount McKinley), North America’s tallest mountain. Along the way, keep an eye out for sightings of the park’s “big five,” Alaska style: moose, caribou, sheep, wolf and cinnamon-color Toklat grizzlies. At the end of the road awaits loon-inhabited Wonder Lake, with stunning reflections of Denali on clear-sky days.\n\nIf an all-day road trip isn’t for you, there are other ways to explore the park: hoisting a backpack for some of the best backcountry hiking anywhere; white-water rafting on the Nenana River; flightseeing around Denali itself; and, for the truly ambitious, climbing Denali’s icy slopes."], ["created_at", 2017-05-17 13:51:06 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-05-17 13:51:06 UTC]]

Perhaps even more bedazzling is the abundance of sealife: humpback whales, orcas, harbor seals, sea otters and Steller sea lions, to name a few local denizens. Bald eagles float along towering cliffs, and seabirds (including cute puffins) congregate by the thousands.\n\nWith more time, seek out Northwestern Lagoon, quiet and serene, ideal for camping in solitary splendor.

Just as amazing is the life in the surrounding waters: more than 30 species of sea animals – sea lions, elephant seals, whales – cavort about.\n\nOf special note: The largest aggregation of blue whales in the world convenes here every summer.

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

And thus begins a brand-new day at Maine’s Acadia National Park.\nIndeed, from its ragged shoreline and sheltered coves, to offshore rocky isles, to the serrated mountains of Mount Desert lording over swaths of pines and marshy meadows, there is much to applaud at this nearly 50,000-acre park. Twenty-mile Park Loop Road is the best way to take it all in, teetering high above the sea with spacious coastal views before careening inland through mountainous forest and meadow-carpeted valleys.\nBe sure to hike or bike along the park’s 57 miles of serene carriage roads — built by John D. Rockefeller, Jr, an early park proponent, to showcase the best Mount Desert vistas. Then back by the sea, take a boat cruise or, better yet, rent a kayak, to see seals sunning themselves on rocks and, if you’re lucky, whales."], ["created_at", 2017-05-22 17:31:44 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-05-22 17:31:44 UTC]]

Just as amazing is the life in the surrounding waters: more than 30 species of sea animals – sea lions, elephant seals, whales – cavort about.\n\nOf special note: The largest aggregation of blue whales in the world convenes here every summer.

Its postage-stamp size, just 26,606 acres preserving ancient volcanic remnants, makes it manageable in a day.

Avoid them by hiking down one of the park’s many trails on foot or by mule — even a mile or two will give you a new perspective. The flat, paved Rim Trail is the easiest, while the classic 9.3-mile Bright Angel Trail is more strenuous but worth every step (remember it’s all uphill on the way back).\n\n Or focus on the pine-forested North Rim, which receives 10 per cent of park visitors.

This is a good thing, given the road’s precipitous, winding nature (and the temptation to keep peering at the ever-more-dramatic landscape).\n\nA constant companion on the southern horizon are the massive, snowcapped peaks of the Alaska Range, topped by the surreal, 20,320-ft Denali (aka Mount McKinley), North America’s tallest mountain. Along the way, keep an eye out for sightings of the park’s “big five,” Alaska style: moose, caribou, sheep, wolf and cinnamon-color Toklat grizzlies.

From your front-row seat you’ll be dazzled by smoky fjords, remote outlying islands and the chance to view blue tidewater glaciers up-close.\n\nAt calving Aialik Glacier, watch huge chunks of ice plummeting into the sea. Perhaps even more bedazzling is the abundance of sealife: humpback whales, orcas, harbor seals, sea otters and Steller sea lions, to name a few local denizens. Bald eagles float along towering cliffs, and seabirds (including cute puffins) congregate by the thousands.\n\nWith more time, seek out Northwestern Lagoon, quiet and serene, ideal for camping in solitary splendor. For landlubbers, the Harding Icefield Trail is a sublime walk from the face of Exit Glacier to Harding Icefield, with the chance to spot black bear along the way.

At the very least, you can hear the scraping, dragging flow of the brittle, glassy lava as it makes its way to the sea; in this way, more than 500 acres of new land have been added to the Big Island since Kīlauea’s latest eruption began in 1983.

In this innermost realm, snowcapped mountains tower more than 7,000 ft, punctuated with 11 major rivers, waterfalls, flower-laden meadows and trout-filled lakes.\n\nThen you have the damp, dripping rain forests, both Hoh and Quinault – among the nation’s finest remaining examples of temperate rain forest, thriving with more than 12 feet of rainfall a year. This mossy, ferny realm, showcasing soaring old-growth trees more than 20 stories high (some 500 years old) is so dark and wet it appears under water.\n\nKeep an eye out for the Gatton Goliath, a 295-ft Douglas-fir, as well as the resident Roosevelt elk. And then you have the Pacific coastline — 73 miles of wild, wave-battered, driftwood-strewn beaches, domain of sea lions and seals.

Beloved symbol of the Old West, this prickly giant is the linchpin of Saguaro National Park, which comprises two units straddling Tucson, Arizona. You’ll find the largest concentration in the park’s hotter, drier Tucson Mountain District unit, to the west of Tucson.\n\nIn the Rincon Mountain District, 30 miles east, the higher, slightly wetter “high desert” environment, you may also spot white-tailed deer, javelinas, Mexican spotted owl, black bears, and, if you’re lucky, the elusive kudamundi. While the saguaro get most of the limelight, you’ll see plenty of other cactus too, including staghorn, barrel, fishhook, prickly pear and teddy bear.\n\nIf you can, visit during the summer wildflower display – Mexican gold poppies kick off the show, followed by penstemons, lupines, desert marigolds and brittlebushes. The saguaros bloom late May through to June — beautiful white flowers that open at night and last for merely 24 hours.

Twenty-mile Park Loop Road is the best way to take it all in, teetering high above the sea with spacious coastal views before careening inland through mountainous forest and meadow-carpeted valleys.\nBe sure to hike or bike along the park’s 57 miles of serene carriage roads — built by John D.

Just as amazing is the life in the surrounding waters: more than 30 species of sea animals – sea lions, elephant seals, whales – cavort about.\n\nOf special note: The largest aggregation of blue whales in the world convenes here every summer.

Beloved symbol of the Old West, this prickly giant is the linchpin of Saguaro National Park, which comprises two units straddling Tucson, Arizona. You’ll find the largest concentration in the park’s hotter, drier Tucson Mountain District unit, to the west of Tucson.\n\nIn the Rincon Mountain District, 30 miles east, the higher, slightly wetter “high desert” environment, you may also spot white-tailed deer, javelinas, Mexican spotted owl, black bears, and, if you’re lucky, the elusive kudamundi. While the saguaro get most of the limelight, you’ll see plenty of other cactus too, including staghorn, barrel, fishhook, prickly pear and teddy bear.\n\nIf you can, visit during the summer wildflower display – Mexican gold poppies kick off the show, followed by penstemons, lupines, desert marigolds and brittlebushes. The saguaros bloom late May through to June — beautiful white flowers that open at night and last for merely 24 hours.

The pièce de résistance, proudly displayed on Utah license plates, is Delicate Arch — with iconic redrock that’s at its most sublime at sunset.\n\nAll that said, there are more than arches here: thin fins, towers, bridges, balanced rocks, and spindly needles add to the otherworldly, high-desert sculpture garden, all with whimsical names that somehow perfectly describe them: Courthouse Towers, Parade of Elephants, and Balanced Rock are some of the favorites. Hikers wander around this stone fantasyland on short and long trails, while rock climbers rejoice in the surrounds.

Twenty-mile Park Loop Road is the best way to take it all in, teetering high above the sea with spacious coastal views before careening inland through mountainous forest and meadow-carpeted valleys.\nBe sure to hike or bike along the park’s 57 miles of serene carriage roads — built by John D.

Just as amazing is the life in the surrounding waters: more than 30 species of sea animals – sea lions, elephant seals, whales – cavort about.\n\nOf special note: The largest aggregation of blue whales in the world convenes here every summer.

With reason. Some may reach over 50 feet tall and last up to 200 years – the biggest may have 40 twisting arms. Beloved symbol of the Old West, this prickly giant is the linchpin of Saguaro National Park, which comprises two units straddling Tucson, Arizona. You’ll find the largest concentration in the park’s hotter, drier Tucson Mountain District unit, to the west of Tucson.\n\nIn the Rincon Mountain District, 30 miles east, the higher, slightly wetter “high desert” environment, you may also spot white-tailed deer, javelinas, Mexican spotted owl, black bears, and, if you’re lucky, the elusive kudamundi. While the saguaro get most of the limelight, you’ll see plenty of other cactus too, including staghorn, barrel, fishhook, prickly pear and teddy bear.\n\nIf you can, visit during the summer wildflower display – Mexican gold poppies kick off the show, followed by penstemons, lupines, desert marigolds and brittlebushes. The saguaros bloom late May through to June — beautiful white flowers that open at night and last for merely 24 hours.

The pièce de résistance, proudly displayed on Utah license plates, is Delicate Arch — with iconic redrock that’s at its most sublime at sunset.\n\nAll that said, there are more than arches here: thin fins, towers, bridges, balanced rocks, and spindly needles add to the otherworldly, high-desert sculpture garden, all with whimsical names that somehow perfectly describe them: Courthouse Towers, Parade of Elephants, and Balanced Rock are some of the favorites. Hikers wander around this stone fantasyland on short and long trails, while rock climbers rejoice in the surrounds.

Twenty-mile Park Loop Road is the best way to take it all in, teetering high above the sea with spacious coastal views before careening inland through mountainous forest and meadow-carpeted valleys.\nBe sure to hike or bike along the park’s 57 miles of serene carriage roads — built by John D.

Just as amazing is the life in the surrounding waters: more than 30 species of sea animals – sea lions, elephant seals, whales – cavort about.\n\nOf special note: The largest aggregation of blue whales in the world convenes here every summer.

Much of the park’s landscape, whether it’s mountain, rainforest, or coastline, remains as it has for hundreds of years. Above all rises Mount Olympus, named by a British fur trader who, upon viewing the mountain at sunset in 1788, thought it could be nothing else but the dwelling place of the gods. In this innermost realm, snowcapped mountains tower more than 7,000 ft, punctuated with 11 major rivers, waterfalls, flower-laden meadows and trout-filled lakes.\n\nThen you have the damp, dripping rain forests, both Hoh and Quinault – among the nation’s finest remaining examples of temperate rain forest, thriving with more than 12 feet of rainfall a year. This mossy, ferny realm, showcasing soaring old-growth trees more than 20 stories high (some 500 years old) is so dark and wet it appears under water.\n\nKeep an eye out for the Gatton Goliath, a 295-ft Douglas-fir, as well as the resident Roosevelt elk. And then you have the Pacific coastline — 73 miles of wild, wave-battered, driftwood-strewn beaches, domain of sea lions and seals. Peek into tide pools, stroll past offshore sea stacks and watch for bald eagles and Western gulls. "], ["created_at", 2017-05-23 14:07:53 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-05-23 14:07:53 UTC]]

With reason. Some may reach over 50 feet tall and last up to 200 years – the biggest may have 40 twisting arms. Beloved symbol of the Old West, this prickly giant is the linchpin of Saguaro National Park, which comprises two units straddling Tucson, Arizona. You’ll find the largest concentration in the park’s hotter, drier Tucson Mountain District unit, to the west of Tucson.\n\nIn the Rincon Mountain District, 30 miles east, the higher, slightly wetter “high desert” environment, you may also spot white-tailed deer, javelinas, Mexican spotted owl, black bears, and, if you’re lucky, the elusive kudamundi. While the saguaro get most of the limelight, you’ll see plenty of other cactus too, including staghorn, barrel, fishhook, prickly pear and teddy bear.\n\nIf you can, visit during the summer wildflower display – Mexican gold poppies kick off the show, followed by penstemons, lupines, desert marigolds and brittlebushes. The saguaros bloom late May through to June — beautiful white flowers that open at night and last for merely 24 hours.

The pièce de résistance, proudly displayed on Utah license plates, is Delicate Arch — with iconic redrock that’s at its most sublime at sunset.\n\nAll that said, there are more than arches here: thin fins, towers, bridges, balanced rocks, and spindly needles add to the otherworldly, high-desert sculpture garden, all with whimsical names that somehow perfectly describe them: Courthouse Towers, Parade of Elephants, and Balanced Rock are some of the favorites.

Just as amazing is the life in the surrounding waters: more than 30 species of sea animals – sea lions, elephant seals, whales – cavort about.\n\nOf special note: The largest aggregation of blue whales in the world convenes here every summer.

Twenty-mile Park Loop Road is the best way to take it all in, teetering high above the sea with spacious coastal views before careening inland through mountainous forest and meadow-carpeted valleys.\nBe sure to hike or bike along the park’s 57 miles of serene carriage roads — built by John D.

Just as amazing is the life in the surrounding waters: more than 30 species of sea animals – sea lions, elephant seals, whales – cavort about.\n\nOf special note: The largest aggregation of blue whales in the world convenes here every summer.

This is a good thing, given the road’s precipitous, winding nature (and the temptation to keep peering at the ever-more-dramatic landscape).\n\nA constant companion on the southern horizon are the massive, snowcapped peaks of the Alaska Range, topped by the surreal, 20,320-ft Denali (aka Mount McKinley), North America’s tallest mountain. Along the way, keep an eye out for sightings of the park’s “big five,” Alaska style: moose, caribou, sheep, wolf and cinnamon-color Toklat grizzlies.

The famous surface lava flows about 12 miles east, at the end of Chain of Craters Road.\n\nThe park provides daily updates of where the lava is flowing — in this capricious landscape it may be a mile from the road, several miles over dicey terrain … or unreachable. At the very least, you can hear the scraping, dragging flow of the brittle, glassy lava as it makes its way to the sea; in this way, more than 500 acres of new land have been added to the Big Island since Kīlauea’s latest eruption began in 1983.

Much of the park’s landscape, whether it’s mountain, rainforest, or coastline, remains as it has for hundreds of years. Above all rises Mount Olympus, named by a British fur trader who, upon viewing the mountain at sunset in 1788, thought it could be nothing else but the dwelling place of the gods. In this innermost realm, snowcapped mountains tower more than 7,000 ft, punctuated with 11 major rivers, waterfalls, flower-laden meadows and trout-filled lakes.\n\nThen you have the damp, dripping rain forests, both Hoh and Quinault – among the nation’s finest remaining examples of temperate rain forest, thriving with more than 12 feet of rainfall a year. This mossy, ferny realm, showcasing soaring old-growth trees more than 20 stories high (some 500 years old) is so dark and wet it appears under water.\n\nKeep an eye out for the Gatton Goliath, a 295-ft Douglas-fir, as well as the resident Roosevelt elk. And then you have the Pacific coastline — 73 miles of wild, wave-battered, driftwood-strewn beaches, domain of sea lions and seals.

With reason. Some may reach over 50 feet tall and last up to 200 years – the biggest may have 40 twisting arms. Beloved symbol of the Old West, this prickly giant is the linchpin of Saguaro National Park, which comprises two units straddling Tucson, Arizona. You’ll find the largest concentration in the park’s hotter, drier Tucson Mountain District unit, to the west of Tucson.\n\nIn the Rincon Mountain District, 30 miles east, the higher, slightly wetter “high desert” environment, you may also spot white-tailed deer, javelinas, Mexican spotted owl, black bears, and, if you’re lucky, the elusive kudamundi. While the saguaro get most of the limelight, you’ll see plenty of other cactus too, including staghorn, barrel, fishhook, prickly pear and teddy bear.\n\nIf you can, visit during the summer wildflower display – Mexican gold poppies kick off the show, followed by penstemons, lupines, desert marigolds and brittlebushes. The saguaros bloom late May through to June — beautiful white flowers that open at night and last for merely 24 hours.

Glacier Point Road leads to perhaps the most spectacular vista in any national park, looking down on Yosemite Valley from 3,200 ft.

As soon as the sun peeks over the horizon they cheer — the first in the country to see the sun’s rays. And thus begins a brand-new day at Maine’s Acadia National Park.\nIndeed, from its ragged shoreline and sheltered coves, to offshore rocky isles, to the serrated mountains of Mount Desert lording over swaths of pines and marshy meadows, there is much to applaud at this nearly 50,000-acre park. Twenty-mile Park Loop Road is the best way to take it all in, teetering high above the sea with spacious coastal views before careening inland through mountainous forest and meadow-carpeted valleys.\nBe sure to hike or bike along the park’s 57 miles of serene carriage roads — built by John D. Rockefeller, Jr, an early park proponent, to showcase the best Mount Desert vistas.

Just as amazing is the life in the surrounding waters: more than 30 species of sea animals – sea lions, elephant seals, whales – cavort about.\n\nOf special note: The largest aggregation of blue whales in the world convenes here every summer.

Glacier Point Road leads to perhaps the most spectacular vista in any national park, looking down on Yosemite Valley from 3,200 ft.

And thus begins a brand-new day at Maine’s Acadia National Park.\nIndeed, from its ragged shoreline and sheltered coves, to offshore rocky isles, to the serrated mountains of Mount Desert lording over swaths of pines and marshy meadows, there is much to applaud at this nearly 50,000-acre park. Twenty-mile Park Loop Road is the best way to take it all in, teetering high above the sea with spacious coastal views before careening inland through mountainous forest and meadow-carpeted valleys.\nBe sure to hike or bike along the park’s 57 miles of serene carriage roads — built by John D. Rockefeller, Jr, an early park proponent, to showcase the best Mount Desert vistas. Then back by the sea, take a boat cruise or, better yet, rent a kayak, to see seals sunning themselves on rocks and, if you’re lucky, whales."], ["created_at", 2017-05-23 14:40:17 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-05-23 14:40:17 UTC]]

Just as amazing is the life in the surrounding waters: more than 30 species of sea animals – sea lions, elephant seals, whales – cavort about.\n\nOf special note: The largest aggregation of blue whales in the world convenes here every summer.

Just as amazing is the life in the surrounding waters: more than 30 species of sea animals – sea lions, elephant seals, whales – cavort about.\n\nOf special note: The largest aggregation of blue whales in the world convenes here every summer.

Twenty-mile Park Loop Road is the best way to take it all in, teetering high above the sea with spacious coastal views before careening inland through mountainous forest and meadow-carpeted valleys.\nBe sure to hike or bike along the park’s 57 miles of serene carriage roads — built by John D.

Just as amazing is the life in the surrounding waters: more than 30 species of sea animals – sea lions, elephant seals, whales – cavort about.\n\nOf special note: The largest aggregation of blue whales in the world convenes here every summer.

The famous surface lava flows about 12 miles east, at the end of Chain of Craters Road.\n\nThe park provides daily updates of where the lava is flowing — in this capricious landscape it may be a mile from the road, several miles over dicey terrain … or unreachable. At the very least, you can hear the scraping, dragging flow of the brittle, glassy lava as it makes its way to the sea; in this way, more than 500 acres of new land have been added to the Big Island since Kīlauea’s latest eruption began in 1983.

Much of the park’s landscape, whether it’s mountain, rainforest, or coastline, remains as it has for hundreds of years. Above all rises Mount Olympus, named by a British fur trader who, upon viewing the mountain at sunset in 1788, thought it could be nothing else but the dwelling place of the gods. In this innermost realm, snowcapped mountains tower more than 7,000 ft, punctuated with 11 major rivers, waterfalls, flower-laden meadows and trout-filled lakes.\n\nThen you have the damp, dripping rain forests, both Hoh and Quinault – among the nation’s finest remaining examples of temperate rain forest, thriving with more than 12 feet of rainfall a year. This mossy, ferny realm, showcasing soaring old-growth trees more than 20 stories high (some 500 years old) is so dark and wet it appears under water.\n\nKeep an eye out for the Gatton Goliath, a 295-ft Douglas-fir, as well as the resident Roosevelt elk. And then you have the Pacific coastline — 73 miles of wild, wave-battered, driftwood-strewn beaches, domain of sea lions and seals.

With reason. Some may reach over 50 feet tall and last up to 200 years – the biggest may have 40 twisting arms. Beloved symbol of the Old West, this prickly giant is the linchpin of Saguaro National Park, which comprises two units straddling Tucson, Arizona. You’ll find the largest concentration in the park’s hotter, drier Tucson Mountain District unit, to the west of Tucson.\n\nIn the Rincon Mountain District, 30 miles east, the higher, slightly wetter “high desert” environment, you may also spot white-tailed deer, javelinas, Mexican spotted owl, black bears, and, if you’re lucky, the elusive kudamundi. While the saguaro get most of the limelight, you’ll see plenty of other cactus too, including staghorn, barrel, fishhook, prickly pear and teddy bear.\n\nIf you can, visit during the summer wildflower display – Mexican gold poppies kick off the show, followed by penstemons, lupines, desert marigolds and brittlebushes.

This is a good thing, given the road’s precipitous, winding nature (and the temptation to keep peering at the ever-more-dramatic landscape).\n\nA constant companion on the southern horizon are the massive, snowcapped peaks of the Alaska Range, topped by the surreal, 20,320-ft Denali (aka Mount McKinley), North America’s tallest mountain. Along the way, keep an eye out for sightings of the park’s “big five,” Alaska style: moose, caribou, sheep, wolf and cinnamon-color Toklat grizzlies. At the end of the road awaits loon-inhabited Wonder Lake, with stunning reflections of Denali on clear-sky days.\n\nIf an all-day road trip isn’t for you, there are other ways to explore the park: hoisting a backpack for some of the best backcountry hiking anywhere; white-water rafting on the Nenana River; flightseeing around Denali itself; and, for the truly ambitious, climbing Denali’s icy slopes."], ["created_at", 2017-05-23 14:54:14 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-05-23 14:54:14 UTC]]

Perhaps even more bedazzling is the abundance of sealife: humpback whales, orcas, harbor seals, sea otters and Steller sea lions, to name a few local denizens. Bald eagles float along towering cliffs, and seabirds (including cute puffins) congregate by the thousands.\n\nWith more time, seek out Northwestern Lagoon, quiet and serene, ideal for camping in solitary splendor.

Avoid them by hiking down one of the park’s many trails on foot or by mule — even a mile or two will give you a new perspective. The flat, paved Rim Trail is the easiest, while the classic 9.3-mile Bright Angel Trail is more strenuous but worth every step (remember it’s all uphill on the way back).\n\n Or focus on the pine-forested North Rim, which receives 10 per cent of park visitors.

This is a good thing, given the road’s precipitous, winding nature (and the temptation to keep peering at the ever-more-dramatic landscape).\n\nA constant companion on the southern horizon are the massive, snowcapped peaks of the Alaska Range, topped by the surreal, 20,320-ft Denali (aka Mount McKinley), North America’s tallest mountain. Along the way, keep an eye out for sightings of the park’s “big five,” Alaska style: moose, caribou, sheep, wolf and cinnamon-color Toklat grizzlies.

Twenty-mile Park Loop Road is the best way to take it all in, teetering high above the sea with spacious coastal views before careening inland through mountainous forest and meadow-carpeted valleys.\nBe sure to hike or bike along the park’s 57 miles of serene carriage roads — built by John D.

Just as amazing is the life in the surrounding waters: more than 30 species of sea animals – sea lions, elephant seals, whales – cavort about.\n\nOf special note: The largest aggregation of blue whales in the world convenes here every summer.

Twenty-mile Park Loop Road is the best way to take it all in, teetering high above the sea with spacious coastal views before careening inland through mountainous forest and meadow-carpeted valleys.\nBe sure to hike or bike along the park’s 57 miles of serene carriage roads — built by John D.

Just as amazing is the life in the surrounding waters: more than 30 species of sea animals – sea lions, elephant seals, whales – cavort about.\n\nOf special note: The largest aggregation of blue whales in the world convenes here every summer.

This mossy, ferny realm, showcasing soaring old-growth trees more than 20 stories high (some 500 years old) is so dark and wet it appears under water.\n\nKeep an eye out for the Gatton Goliath, a 295-ft Douglas-fir, as well as the resident Roosevelt elk. And then you have the Pacific coastline — 73 miles of wild, wave-battered, driftwood-strewn beaches, domain of sea lions and seals. Peek into tide pools, stroll past offshore sea stacks and watch for bald eagles and Western gulls. "], ["created_at", 2017-05-23 15:04:26 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-05-23 15:04:26 UTC]]

With reason. Some may reach over 50 feet tall and last up to 200 years – the biggest may have 40 twisting arms. Beloved symbol of the Old West, this prickly giant is the linchpin of Saguaro National Park, which comprises two units straddling Tucson, Arizona. You’ll find the largest concentration in the park’s hotter, drier Tucson Mountain District unit, to the west of Tucson.\n\nIn the Rincon Mountain District, 30 miles east, the higher, slightly wetter “high desert” environment, you may also spot white-tailed deer, javelinas, Mexican spotted owl, black bears, and, if you’re lucky, the elusive kudamundi. While the saguaro get most of the limelight, you’ll see plenty of other cactus too, including staghorn, barrel, fishhook, prickly pear and teddy bear.\n\nIf you can, visit during the summer wildflower display – Mexican gold poppies kick off the show, followed by penstemons, lupines, desert marigolds and brittlebushes. The saguaros bloom late May through to June — beautiful white flowers that open at night and last for merely 24 hours.

The pièce de résistance, proudly displayed on Utah license plates, is Delicate Arch — with iconic redrock that’s at its most sublime at sunset.\n\nAll that said, there are more than arches here: thin fins, towers, bridges, balanced rocks, and spindly needles add to the otherworldly, high-desert sculpture garden, all with whimsical names that somehow perfectly describe them: Courthouse Towers, Parade of Elephants, and Balanced Rock are some of the favorites. Hikers wander around this stone fantasyland on short and long trails, while rock climbers rejoice in the surrounds.
